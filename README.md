# Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using Sensor Fusion  

## Overview  
This project implements **Human Activity Recognition (HAR)** using time-series data from wearable motion sensors (accelerometer & gyroscope). By combining two benchmark datasets ‚Äî **UCI HAR** and **PAMAP2** ‚Äî we designed robust deep learning models to classify human activities such as walking, sitting, standing, and lying down.  

The work explores **sensor fusion**, advanced preprocessing techniques, and hybrid neural architectures (**CNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, CNN-LSTM with Attention**) to improve recognition accuracy across multiple sensor setups.

##  Key Features  
-  **Sensor Fusion**: Combined accelerometer and gyroscope signals along 3 axes (X, Y, Z).  
-  **Preprocessing**: Resampling (K-Max Pooling), normalization, segmentation (2.56s windows, 50% overlap), and label alignment.  
-  **Deep Learning Models**: Implemented 1D-CNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and hybrid CNN-LSTM with Attention.  
-  **Performance**: Achieved ~91% accuracy and 90.8% F1-score across six core activities.  
-  **Applications**: Smart healthcare (fall detection, elderly monitoring), fitness tracking, IoT automation, firefighting/military safety monitoring.
